After being approached by parents wanting a rigorous academic high school that allows a student to work off campus some days, we agreed to establish a new school in Lynchburg. Our new program offers Tues/Wed/Thurs on campus and a reasonable tuition. We are meeting at Providence Church on Melinda Drive. [Contact us](/#contact) for an admissions packet or to make a reservation to attend one of our regular Saturday informational open houses.
