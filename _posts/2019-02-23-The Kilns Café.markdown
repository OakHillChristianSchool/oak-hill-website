The Kilns, also known as The C.S. Lewis House

It may not seem like the likeliest hang out spot, but Oak Hill has quite a few parents who enjoy meeting up on campus.  Some like to sit quietly and wait while their children are attending after school activities. Rather than leaving parents in empty classrooms or in an empty spot in the halls, we now have a comfortable place for them to chat or wait, The Kilns Café.

We know that many of you may head over to Starbucks, but we invite you to see what The Kilns has to offer. You may be quite surprised by the offerings of our simple cafe. We serve coffee that is ground daily with locally roasted beans. Do you prefer tea? We have some of the finest teas; come in and not only see but smell the delicious teas we have. We may not have your favorite latte, but we make delicious milk steamers that are similar. Made fresh for you with steamed milk, they contain naturally flavored sugar syrups and are topped with coffee or tea. And the competition cannot beat the convenience as we are right here as you walk past us on your way out the door of the school.

If you aren't already sold on the idea, we want you to know that we have fresh baked goods, sweet and savory. And anyone is certain to enjoy an Italian soda, made with ice cold sparkling water and all natural syrups like strawberry and lavender. Our café is staffed by trained student volunteers with the help of teachers and parents. It's a great place to build community at our school.

This is all just the beginning. We have some very exciting plans that will be built upon The Kilns Café. We are preparing for a new phase of the school, one emphasizing the analogy of the potter and clay vessels. There is so much more to this story that has yet to be told.

"But now, O Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand."
Isaiah 64:8
