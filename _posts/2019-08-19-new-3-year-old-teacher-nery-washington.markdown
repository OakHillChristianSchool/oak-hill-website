Nery Washington is coming aboard this September as a new Junior Kindergarten teacher.  Her own children will also be attending OH.   A longtime friend of the school, Mrs. Washington earned a bachelor’s degree in early childhood and successfully taught her own children reading and many other things.    She brings to the classroom a lot of competence, love for God and for children, and appreciation for our school’s curriculum.
