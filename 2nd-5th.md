**Grammar School Curriculum Overview and Sampling**

Are you tired of computers and lessons in extraneous topics? Enjoy seeing your child continue to build a strong foundation in true academic areas during his **Grammar School** years.

Even from this age students are pushed towards the solidifying analysis and communication of the logic and rhetoric levels of learning, though the primary focus is on filling the mind with knowledge. At OH you may see 5th graders having a class debate of British vs. Colonists, 4th graders giving discovery presentations about electricity, 3rd graders acting out ancient customs or 2nd graders dressing up for a play.

**History and Bible Courses** using Veritas curriculum emphasize learning events and historical figures through projects as well as by answering questions in complete sentences and short essays. Students learn to do independent research using pre-selected sources.
