    <h3>Welcome to Oak Hill Christian School – 3 Days on Campus High School</h3>
    <p>
      Our Herndon 3 day on campus high school is open to all Christian families
      seeking a safe and secure setting for their high school-aged children.
      Using a 3-Day hybrid schedule, students are on-campus Tues, Wed, Thur and
      then work independently off-campus Mon & Fri. (We also offer a separate 5
      day high school.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We are homeschool-friendly and provide a full 4-year high school
      curriculum to include History, Literature, Bible, English, Math, Science,
      Choir and Latin – all taught using the classical Christian approach. We
      encourage students to use local sports leagues.
