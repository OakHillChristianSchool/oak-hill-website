<div class="uk-container uk-container-xsmall uk-margin-xlarge">
    <p>Nearly all four year olds in our preschool learn to read using our proven phonics method while Kindergarten students typically read on a third grade level by the end of the year. Curriculum includes math, science, Bible, music, art, penmanship, foreign language, history and geography as well as outdoor play. Our classes at this level feature no pressure. Students learn through music, crafts, physical activity and in many other ways. We use Saxon Math 1 in the Kindergarten and Saxon Kindergarten Math in Junior Kindergarten.  Three year olds receive the same instruction but at a slower pace.</p>
