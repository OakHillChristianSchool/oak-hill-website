Good teaching starts with where a student is. By Junior High years, you may notice that your child loves to argue. Our curriculum takes advantage of this newfound love of argument, teaching how to reason critically from a Christian perspective.

Students receive formal training in logic and learn to reason critically from a Christian perspective. They practice these skills as they debate, participate in class discussions and critique one another.
