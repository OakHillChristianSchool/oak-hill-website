Grade school, or grammar school, is a time for developing structures that reward self-control and personal discipline. Habits and concepts learned at this early age will stick for life if they are taught in an interesting and engaging way.

* Using [Shurley English](https://www.shurley.com/), students learn grammar. Come see first graders diagramming sentences!
* The outstanding [Excellence in Writing](http://www.iew.com/) program teaches artful communication.
* [Saxon Math](http://www.hmhco.com/shop/education-curriculum/math/saxon-math) is used one year ahead of grade level preparing students for pre-algebra and beyond.
* Students travel to our science lab for elementary courses in Chemistry, Astronomy & Geoscience, Physics, and Biology. They learn scientific method and how to organize a laboratory notebook.
* Latin with our veteran language instructors.
* Students read original works, from Curious George and Madeline in first grade to Robin Hood and Where the Red Fern Grows in older grades. As much as possible books that relate to a particular period in history are read while students are studying that time in history.

Even from this age students are pushed towards the solidifying analysis and communication of logic and rhetoric levels of learning, though the primary focus is on filling the mind with knowledge. If you visit, you may see 5th graders having a class debate of British vs. Colonists, 4th graders giving discovery presentations about electricity, 3rd graders acting out ancient customs, 2nd graders dressing up for a play, or 1st graders explaining their favorite U.S. Presidents.
