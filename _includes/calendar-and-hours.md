Closings or changes in our schedule due to weather are posted at <a href="https://wtop.com/" target="_blank">WTOP.com</a> and on our school <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oakhillk12/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.  There will also be a recording announcing any changes at 703-796-6887. We do not always follow the county schools.  In the event that we are prevented from posting an announcement due to interruptions in phone or internet service, parents should still be able to find our status by checking closings at <a href="https://wtop.com/" target="_blank">WTOP.com</a>.

The school year for PK-8th Grade includes 175 days.  Five additional days are scheduled for weather or other closings.  The year will end early if all these days are not needed.  If this causes the last day to fall on a Monday, we will conclude the year on the previous Friday instead.  In the unexpected event of more than five snow closings, the days may or may not be rescheduled at the discretion of the school.
