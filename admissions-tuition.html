  <p>
    Tuition is not the only thing because it is our desire to help build godly
    families. If you may have a strong interest in Oak Hill but tuition is above
    your budget, we encourage you to pursue enrollment anyway. We are happy to
    discuss scholarship options.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even if tuition is in your budget, we know that it is a sacrifice on your
    part. Since we constantly hear that something can be had for nothing, it is
    easy to overlook the hidden costs of "free" education or the price of not
    finding academically rigorous and authentically Christian education.
  </p>
  <p>
    OH scholarships are funded solely by the school and are available based on
    need, available funding, and the family's commitment to the mission of the
    school.
