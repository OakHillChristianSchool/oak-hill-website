    <h3>F.A.S.T. — Financial Aid for School Tuition</h3>
    <p>Families who have a strong interest are encouraged to apply for admission regardless of means. Partial
        scholarships are funded by the school and are available based on need, available funding, and the family’s
        commitment to the mission of the school. Awards may range from $1,000 to a full tuition scholarship. Application
		should be made online at the link below with Independent School Management’s FAST program. Once a confidential application has
        been completed FAST will make a recommendation to the school.</p>
