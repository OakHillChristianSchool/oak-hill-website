    <h3>Financial Aid</h3>
    <p>Finding the best instruction for your son or daughter is a sacrifice. In an age when we are constantly told something can be had for nothing, it is easy to overlook the hidden costs of "free" education or the price of not finding solid value in helping to teach your children.</p>
  <p>Tuition is not the only thing and it is our desire to enable enrollment for families that have a strong interest in academically rigorous and authentically Christian education. If your budget makes OH not seem possible, we encourage you to:</p>
  <p><li>Discuss fees or financial aid with one of our admissions counsellors, or
  <li>Apply online for a scholarship by following the link below to our FAST application.<p>
  <p>OH scholarships are funded solely by the school and are available based on need, available funding, and the family's commitment to the mission of the school.</p>
